The type of contract signed between a teacher and a school can vary based on various factors such as the teacher's role, employment status, and the school's policies. Here are some common types of contracts you might encounter:

1. **Full-Time Permanent Contract:** This type of contract is for full-time teachers who are hired on a permanent basis, typically with ongoing employment until retirement or resignation.

2. **Part-Time Contract:** Part-time teachers may have contracts specifying their work hours and responsibilities, often based on a fraction of a full-time position.

3. **Fixed-Term Contract:** Teachers may be hired for a specific period, such as one academic year or a specific project. The contract ends automatically at the end of the term unless renewed.

4. **Probationary Contract:** New teachers might start with a probationary contract, allowing the school to evaluate their performance before offering a permanent position.

5. **Substitute or Relief Contract:** Teachers hired on a substitute or relief basis fill in for regular teachers during their absence. These contracts are often short-term and may be on-call.

6. **Casual or Hourly Contract:** Some teachers, especially for specific tasks like tutoring or workshops, may have hourly contracts without a fixed schedule or long-term commitment.

7. **Consulting or Independent Contractor Agreement:** In some cases, teachers may work as independent contractors rather than employees, with contracts specifying project-based work or consulting services.

The specific terms, conditions, benefits, and responsibilities outlined in these contracts can vary widely depending on local laws, union agreements (if applicable), school policies, and negotiations between the teacher and the school administration.
